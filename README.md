Jenkins
Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for building, testing, and deploying software projects. 
It's widely used in the software industry to streamline the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines, enabling teams to deliver high-quality software more efficiently.
It allows developers to automate various aspects of the software development process, such as compiling code, running tests, and deploying applications. 
Jenkins is highly extensible through plugins, which provide integration with various tools and technologies commonly used in software development, such as version control systems, build tools, and issue trackers.
